# Offline usage

Offline usage could be a great niche for AdEx to enter, since this pretty much a unique feature in ad networks.

An example of such an use case is offline entertainment systems. Another usecase is IoT devices 

Almost everything in AdEx can be tuned to work offline - messages from the user can be buffered and sent when a connection is available, and same goes for Ethereum interactions.

However, the challenge with offline usage remains the counting of the clicks - since there is no way to implement a global counting mechanism. In order to work around that, AdEx could implement alternative bidding strategies: instead of bidding for number of clicks, one could bid to take an ad slot exclusively for a certain period of time. Alternatively, one could bid to just participate in the ad selection process for an ad slot for a certain amount of time - meaning, they will compete with other ad units for the given time, and will be selected based on user taste.

All of this does not diminish the reporting, which will still be submitted as soon as there is an available connection
